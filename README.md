# Automated-Bird-Species-Identification-using-Audio-Signal-Processing-

-This research explores approaches for bird identification and develops an automated system for recognizing bird
species. Significant study on taxonomy and other subfields of ornithology has been a challenging and difficult
endeavour for automatic identification of bird sounds without physical involvement. A two-stage identification
approach is used in this work. The first step was creating an ideal dataset that included all of the bird species' sound
recordings. The sound snippets were then put through a variety of sound preprocessing procedures, including preemphasis, framing, silence removal, and reconstruction. For each reconstructed sound clip, spectrograms were
produced. In the subsequent stage, a neural network was set up and given the spectrograms as input. The Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) categorizes the sound sample and determines the species of bird based on the input features.
For the aforementioned, a real-time implementation model was also created and used.
